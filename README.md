## Description
[http://emoteracer.xyz/](http://emoteracer.xyz/) is a free online multiplayer [Twitch Emote](https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp/en/learn-the-basics/emotes/) typing/guessing game, where you try to guess the name of a given emote. You can choose to play battle royale, 1 vs 1, or practice alone.

This was forked because the original Emote Racer was taken offline (and I assume not developed anymore). I am planning on adding more emotes and keeping it online :)

## Support
